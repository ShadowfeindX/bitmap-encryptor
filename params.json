  "tagline": "The ultimate in bitmap encryption software!",
  "body": "##Updates\r\n- Command line usage added\r\n- File processing heavily optimized\r\n- Multi-threading for simultaneous decrypting and encrypting\r\n\r\nHave you ever had an image that you wanted to offload to an external drive or upload to the cloud,\r\nbut you were afraid of it falling into the wrong hands?\r\n\r\n#Introducing the Cryptomatic 9000!\r\nThis ingenious piece of software will tear up your picture and re-arrange it into an entirely new image!\r\nAnd this isn't simple shredding either. The Cryptomatic 9000 will split your image at the molecular level\r\ninto MILLIONS of pixels before regrouping them in a completely RANDOM order! Not only that, but it also recalculates\r\na new RGB(hex) value for each pixel it scans, making it impossible for onlookers to even attempt to identify even the\r\noriginal colors, much less the image itself.  \r\n###Behold the 3 S's of the Cryptomatic!\r\n\r\n##Secure!\r\nNormal encryption programs provide you with a master key that will allow you to decrypt any images encrypted with that key,\r\nbut that leaves a gaping security hole if someone were to obtain or even generate that key on their own.\r\n\r\nEach image encrypted by the Cryptomatic also has a unique key generated that will only decrypt that image. What's more\r\nthe key is also an image (a very very tiny image) so you won't have to remember any long hex-keys or the like!\r\n\r\n##Safe!\r\nIn order to start the encryption process, you must first input your own cryptokey and the name of the file you wish to encrypt.\r\nThis prevents you from accidentally encrypting the wrong image!\r\n\r\n##Super Cool!\r\nNot only does the Cryptomatic allow you to protect whatever images you may have, but it does so without any lossy features, like compression,\r\nand without exposing any unnecessary security flaws. PLUS, the images it generates look pretty cool too!\r\n\r\n#Usage Info\r\n*Disclaimer*: Currently only supports bitmap images! Not packaged for release!\r\n\r\nIf you have a version of Ruby installed you can download the source and run it with `rake` or `rake start`  \r\nYou can also run the main script directly using `ruby bin/main` from the project folder.  \r\nYou can also use the script as a command line tool!  \r\nRun `ruby bin/main -h` for more usage info.\r\n\r\n#Example Images\r\n[img1_o]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img1.bmp \"Test Image 1 (Original)\"\r\n[img2_o]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img2.bmp \"Test Image 2 (Original)\"\r\n[img3_o]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img3.bmp \"Test Image 3 (Original)\"\r\n[img4_o]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img4.bmp \"Test Image 4 (Original)\"\r\n[img5_o]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img5.bmp \"Test Image 5 (Original)\"\r\n[img6_o]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img6.bmp \"Test Image 6 (Original)\"\r\n\r\n[img1_e]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img1_enc.bmp \"Test Image 1 (Encrypted)\"\r\n[img2_e]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img2_enc.bmp \"Test Image 2 (Encrypted)\"\r\n[img3_e]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img3_enc.bmp \"Test Image 3 (Encrypted)\"\r\n[img4_e]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img4_enc.bmp \"Test Image 4 (Encrypted)\"\r\n[img5_e]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img5_enc.bmp \"Test Image 5 (Encrypted)\"\r\n[img6_e]: https://github.com/ShadowfeindX/bitmap-encryptor/raw/master/data/img6_enc.bmp \"Test Image 6 (Encrypted)\"\r\n\r\n| Original          | Encrypted         |\r\n|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|\r\n|![alt text][img1_o]|![alt text][img1_e]|\r\n|![alt text][img2_o]|![alt text][img2_e]|\r\n|![alt text][img3_o]|![alt text][img3_e]|\r\n|![alt text][img4_o]|![alt text][img4_e]|\r\n|![alt text][img5_o]|![alt text][img5_e]|\r\n|![alt text][img6_o]|![alt text][img6_e]|\r\n\r\n#Coming Soon: The Cryptomatic 9001!\r\nIt's the same thing...but over 9000!\r\n\r\nOh, it also adds audio file encryption.\r\n\r\nAnd multi-threading, did I mention that?\r\n",
